\begin{abstract}
We aim to calculate the Verdet constant relating the change in magnetic field through a medium sample to the change in polarization angle of light traveling through the medium.  A {\bf wavelength?} laser was sent through a solenoid containing a {\bf glass?} rod and an adjustable polarizer and received by a photodiode. A lock-in amplifier was used on the voltage output of the photodiode to reduce background noise. The phase offset was found by performing a non-linear least squares regression on the output voltage ($V$) versus polarizer angle ($\theta$) data for four $B$ fields. The Verdet constant for the sample was calculated from phase differences due to changes in the magnetic fields and found to be 20.1 $\frac{1}{mT*m}$ ERROR.

\section{Introduction} 

{The Faraday Effect is a magneto-optical phenomenon in which light of a single wavelength, traveling through a medium of a certain refractive index subject to a magnetic field, experiences a shift in the plane of polarization.  This has to do with the fact that light has a right-hand circularly polarized component and a left-hand circularly polarized component.  If it is sent through a medium considered to be birefringent (having a different refractive index for light in different polarization orientations), the relative phase angle between the two components will have changed and the overall plane of polarization will have rotated.}

{As shown in Equation 1, the Verdet Constant ($V_{c}$) relates the change in magnetic field of a medium to the change in polarization angle of the traveling light.  $V_{c}$ is specific to any medium.  There are two ways in which we can calculate $V_{c}$.  By Malus's Law, $I(\phi)$=$I_{0}*\cos^{2}(\phi)$, where $I$ is the intensity of measured light through a polarization filter of angle $\phi$ with respect to the maximal polarization angle (which would transmit light of intensity $I_{0}$.  Similarly, for voltage output, $V(\phi)$=$V_{0}*\cos^{2}(\phi)$.  Once we add into this set-up a magnetic field through which the light can travel, we will observe the voltage output equation to have a phase shift, $\theta$:  $V(\phi)$=$V_{0}*\cos^{2}(\phi+\theta)$.}

{One way to calculate $V_{c}$ is to measure the phase shift, $\theta$ for multiple magnetic fields:  collecting data for $V(\phi)$ for a full 0-360 degree range of $\phi$ and comparing data for different magnetic fields to a base data set of the same set up, where there is no magnetic field.  $\theta$ can be plotted against $B$- they should have a linear relationship- and by finding the slope of that linear fit, $\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial B}$ will be found and thus $V_{c}$ by Equation 1.}

{Another way to find $V_{c}$ is to notice that $\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial B}= \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial V}*\frac{\partial V}{\partial B}$}
